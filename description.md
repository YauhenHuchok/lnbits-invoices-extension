Create invoices that you can send to your client to pay online over Lightning.

Create "traditional" invoices (not in the lightning sense) that contain one or more line items. Line items are denominated in a user-configurable fiat currency. Each invoice contains one or more payments up to the total of the invoice. Each invoice creates a public link that can be shared with a customer that they can use to (partially or in full) pay the invoice.
